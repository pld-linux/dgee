- rel 0.1.5
- add logrotate script
- add empty log files owned by root.http with 660 perms (I think this
  perms should be 620, but goldwater opens log files in rw mode)
- add /sbin/ldconfig in %post %postun
- fix file's prems in /usr/lib/dgee directory
- it works! - goldwater starts correctly and it can boot dgee apps
